# Smith_Lab_LinEs

Smith_Lab_LinEs contains 2 MATLAB scripts used to analyze microscopy data generated by Yu-Chien Chuang for the submitted manuscript:

Dynamic configurations of meiotic DNA break hotspot determinants.
Yu-Chien Chuang & Gerald R. Smith

The image dataset has been acquired by Structure Illumination Micrscopy using a VT-iSIM system (VisiTech International). Images contain a stack of one channel z-sections at 32-bit depth resolution in .tif format. The scripts invoke the MATLAB bioformat readers package (bfmatlab) that can be downloaded at: https://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4/

*MainGerry.m* identifies yeast cells to analyze, initialize the variables and call the analyzing function GerryDist()

*GerryDist.m* quantifies the GFP elements in each yeast and returns S metrics used to quantify the phenotypes:

-maxLength: the geodesic length (in voxels) of each GFP element  
-Volume: the volume (in voxels) of each element  
-MeanIntensity: the mean GFP intensity of each element  
-IntegralIntensity: the integral intensity of each element  
-VoxelIdxList: the indices of each voxel in each element  

The *SampleImage* folder contains 1 image file in .tif format as an input example.
